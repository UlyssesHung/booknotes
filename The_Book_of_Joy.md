## Day 1: The Nature of True Joy
### Why are you not morose?
- Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. Feelings of pain+The suffering that comes as a result of our response=feeling the pain of two arrows. We can avoid it by.
- If something can be done about the situation, what need is there for dejection. And if nothing can be done about it, what use is there for being dejected.
- Shift of perspective, from oneself and toward others, from anguish to compassion. Seeing that others are suffering as well. We are not alone, our pain is lessened.
- There are different aspects of any event. The tragedy give Dalai Lama the new opportunities to learn, to experience life.
### Nothing Beautiful Comes Without Some Suffering
- I think some suffering, maybe even intense suffering, is a necessary ingredient for life, certainly for developing compassion.
- Self-centered thinking is the source of suffering. By simplely shifting my focus to another person, which is what compassion does, my own pain was much less intense.
- In fact, taking care of others, helping others, ultimately is the way to discover your own joy and to have a happy life.
- We will accustom any new situations, so win a lottery doesn't make you happy for long time. Only 50% of happyness is determined by immutable factors.
### Have You Renounced Pleasure?
- Not eating out of greed. Sensory happiness is not long-lasting and will become nomb to its effect. Only the happiness in deeper level will long-lasting. The generosity is natural born in our brain. We can have happiness by helping others.
### Our Greatest Joy
- Unfortunately, in our world we tend to be blind to our connection until times of great disaster.
- Make more friends. How? Trust. How to develop trust? To show your genuine sense of concern for their well-being.
- Paradox: Is pursuing happyness of ourself self-centered which is the opposite of true happyness. No, We we are able to move beyond our own pain and suffering, we are more available to others.

## Day 2: The Obstacles to Joy
### We Are a Masterpiece of Making
- We are human beings, so these negative thoughts: fear, frustration, anger are natural. However, by developing mental immunity, we can alleviate these thoughts and prevent these emotional reaction become destructive.
- How? Understand and analyse the cause of these thoughts. Emotions are actually mental projection, so we can change it. For people cases, be compassionate and try to understand their pain and suffering. For circustance cases, understand your emotion doesn't help anything. Through meditation, we can develop these skill better.

### Feer, Stress, And Anxiety I Will Be Bery Nervious.
- Mandela: \[I learned that courage was not the absense of fear, but the triumph over it.\]
- Stress and anxiety often come from too much expectation and too much ambition. Think about how little we really need-love and connection. Dalai Lama was urging us to be more realistic so we can come to some sense of inner peace now, rather than always chasing after our expectations and ambition for the next.
- See threats as challenges, our body responds very differently. Threat stress harm us, challenge stress help us grow. How to see it depends on you.
- Desmond Tutu: \[What the Dakai Lama and I are offering is a way of handing your worries: thinking about others. You can think about others who are in a similar situation or perhaps even in a worse situation, but who have survived, eve thrived. It does help qyite a lot to see yourself as part of greater whole.
- What do you need to fear or worry about when you have seven billion other people who are with you.

### Frustration and Anger. I Would Shout
- Fear and anger are natural emotions from flee-and-fight. Two ways to reduce the distructive emotions.
- First, compassion, other people have the same situations.
- Second, reasoning, anger will distruct our mind and brain and make us cannot think clearly. Understand anger cannot solve the problem and only cause the problems.
