# Designing Your Life

## URL
- http://designingyour.life/resources-authorized/

## 1. Start Where You Are
- Problem Finding + Problem Solving = Well-Designed Life
- Deciding which problems to work on may be one of the most important decisions you make, because people can lose years (or a life time) working on the wrong problem
- Not actionable problem is not a problem. We call it gravity problem. Ex1: Gravity, employer's perception about  five-year unemployed job seeker(though it is unreasonable)
- The key is not to get stuck on something that you have effectively no chance of succeeding at.
- The only response to a gravity problem is acceptance. And this is where all good designers begin. This is the "You are Her" or "Accept" phase of design thinking. Acceptance. That's why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. Be right where your are.

### [Try Stuff]The Life Design Assessment: The Health/Work/Play/Love Dashboard
1. Write a few sentences about how it's going in each of the four areas.
2. Mark where you are (0 to Full) on each gauge.
3. Ask yourself if there's a design problem you'd like to tackle in any of these areas.
4. Now ask yourself if your "problem" is a gravity problem

## 2. Building a Compass

### Workview Reflection
- Why work?
- What's work for?
- What does work mean?
- How does it relate to the individual, others, and society?
- What defines good or worthwile work?
- What does money have to with it?
- What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with it?

### Lifeview Reflection
- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning or purpose of life?
- What is the relationship between the individual and others?
- Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?
- What is good, and what is evil?
- Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on your life?
- What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?

### Coherency and Workview-Lifeview Integration
- Where do your view on work and life complement one another?
- Where do they clash?
- Does one drive the other? How?

### [Try Stuff] Workview and Lifeview
1. Write a short reflection about your Workview. This should take about 30 minutes. Shoot for about 250 words-less than a page of typed writing.
2. Write a short reflection about your Workview. This should take no more than 30 minutes and be 250 words or so.
3. Read over your Lifeview and Workview, and the answer of the questions in Coherency and Workview-Lifeview Integration section

## 3. Wayfinding
- The clues of finding your way is **Engagement** and **Energy**

### Engagement

#### Flow: Total Engagement
- Experience complete involvement in the activity.
- Feeling a sence of ecstasy or euphoria.
- Having great inner clarity-knowing just what to do and how to do it.
- Being totally calm and at peace.
- Feeling as if time where standing still-or disappearing in a instant.

### Energy
- Pay attention to your energy level.

### Good Time Journal Exercise
- Activity Log (Where I record where I'm engaged and energized)
- Reflection (Where I discover what I am learning)

### Zoom In-Getting to the good Stuff

### AEIOU
- Use Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, Users to record your reflection.

### Mining the Mountaintop
- You can not only record the activity now, but the past.

### [Try Stuff] Good Time Journal
1. Complete a log of your daily activities, using the worksheet provided (or in your own notebook). Note whe you are engaged and/or energized and what you are doing diring those times. Try to do this daily or at the very least every few days.
2. Continue this daily logging for three weeks.
3. At the end of each week, jot down your reflections-notice which activities are engaging and energizing, and which one are not.
4. Are there any surpises in your reflections?
5. Zoom in and try to get even specific about what does or does not engage and energize you.
6. Use the AEIOU method as needed to help you in your reflection.


## 4. Getting Unstuck
- Look, it's simple. You can't know what you want until you know what you might want, so you are going to have to generate a lot of ideas and possibilities.
- Designers learn to have lots of wild ideas because they know that the number one enemy of creativity is judgement.
- Do not fall in love with your first idea. This relationship almost never work out.

### Ideate this
1. You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from.
2. You never choose your first solution to any problem.

### Mind Mapping
1. Pick a topic
2. Making the mind map
3. Making secondary connections and creating concepts (mash it all up)

### Stuck in Steroids: Anchor Problems
- An anchor problem is a real problem, just a hard one. It's actionable-but we've been stuck on it so long or so often that it seems in surmoutable (which is why such a problem has to be reframed, then opened up with new ideas, then knocked down to size by prototyping). Gravity problems aren't actually problems.

### Mind Mapping with Your Good Time Journal
- Mind Map 1-Engagement
- Mind Map 2-Energy
- Mind Map 3-Flow

### [Try Stuff] Mind Mapping
1. Review your Good Time Journal and note activities in which you were engaged, energized, and in flow
2. Choose an activity that you were engaged in, and activity that you felt highly energized from, and something you did that brought you into flow, and create three mind maps-one for each.
3. Look at the outer ring of each mind map, pick three things that jump out at you, and create a job description from them.
4. Create a role for each job description, and draw a napkin sketch.

## 5. Design Your Lives
- Just ask. You've nothing to lose by asking.
- There are multiple great lives(and plans) within me, and I get to choose which one to build my way forward to next.

### Odyssey Plans
- Image and write up three different versions of next five years of your life.

#### A way to quickly come up three versions
- Life One: That thing you do.
- Life Two: That thing you'd do if thing one were suddenly gone.
- Life Three: The thing you'd do or the life you'd live if money or image were no object.

### Each Odyssey Plan Should Includes
1. A visual/graphical timeline. Include personal and noncareer events as well—do you want to be married, train to win the CrossFit Games, or learn how to bend spoons with your mind?
2. A title for each option in the form of a six-word headline describing the essence of this alternative.
3. Questions that this alternative is asking—preferably two or three. A good designer asks questions to test assumptions and reveal new insights. In each potential timeline, you will investigate different possibilities and learn different things about yourself and the world. What kinds of things will you want to test and explore in each alternative version of your life?
4. A dashboard where you can gauge
	1. Resources (Do you have the objective resources—time, money, skill, contacts—you need to pull off your plan?)
	2. Likability (Are you hot or cold or warm about your plan?)
	3. Confidence (Are you feeling full of confidence, or pretty uncertain about pulling this off?)
	4. Coherence (Does the plan make sense within itself? And is it consistent with you, your Workview, and your Lifeview?)
5. Possible considerations
	- Geography—where will you live?
	- What experience/learning will you gain?
	- What are the impacts/results of choosing this alternative?
	- What will life look like? What particular role, industry, or company do you see yourself in?
6. Other ideas
	- Do keep in mind things other than career and money. Even though those things are important, if not central, to the decisive direction of your next few years, there are other critical elements that you want to pay attention to.
	- Any of the considerations listed above can be a springboard for forming your alternative lives for the next five years. If you find yourself stuck, try making a mind map out of any of the design considerations listed above. Don’t overthink this exercise, and don’t skip it.

### [Try Stuff] Odyssey Plan
1. Create three alternative five-year plans, using the worksheet provided.
2. Give each alternative a descriptive six-word title, and write down three questions that arise out of each version of you.
3. Complete each gauge on the dashboard—ranking each alternative for resources, likability, confidence, and coherence.
4. Present your plan to another person, a group, or your Life Design Team. Note how each alternative energizes you.

## 6. Prototyping
- Trying is a way to prevent from waste of time. Even you are very sure you like something, but the real situation may different from what you think. In a lof of cases, we only saw the good part of a thing and ignore the bad part.

### Prototype Conversations- Life Design Interview
- Interview someone who has the life you want to live
- With a polite question like this: **John said you were just the person I needed to speak with. I’m very impressed with what I know of your work, and I’d love to hear some of your story. Might you have thirty minutes to spare, at a time and place convenient to you, when I can buy you a cup of coffee and hear more about your experience?”**

### Brainstorming Prototype Experiences
- Brainstorming, a technique for generating lots of creative and out-of-the-box ideas, was first described by Alex Osborn in a book published in 1953 called Applied Imagination. He described a method of generating ideas that relied on two rules: generating a large quantity of ideas without concern for quality, and deferring judgment so that participants would not censor ideas.

#### Steps
1. Framing a good questions
	1. Open-ended
	2. Not includes a pre-defined solution to your question.
	3. Not too broad.
2. Warming Up
	 1. Play-Doh
3. The brainstorn itself
	 1. Go for quantity, not quality.
	 2. Defer judgement and do not censor ideas.
	 3. Build off the ideas from others.
	 4. Encourage wild ideas.
4. Naming and framing outcomes
	 1. Ideas should be counted
	 2. Classify them to different categories like these:
		 - Most exciting
		 - The one we wish we could do if money were no object
		 - The dark horse—probably won’t work, but if it did…
		 - Most likely to lead to a great life
		 - If we could ignore the laws of physics…

## [Try Stuff] Prototyping
1. Review your three Odyssey Plans and the questions you wrote down for each.
2. Make a list of prototype conversations that might help you answer these questions.
3. Make a list of prototype experiences that might help you answer these questions.
4. If you are stuck, and if you have gathered a good group, have a brainstorming session to come up with possibilities. (Don’t have a team? Try mind mapping.)
5. Build your prototypes by actively seeking out Life Design Interviews and experiences.

## 7. Why Not to Get a Job
- Mining the internet almost useless.

### Understand the job description
1. The job description on the website is typically not written by the hiring manager or someone who really understands the job.
2. The job description almost never captures what the job actually requires for success.

### Fit in before you stand out
- Tip 1: Rewrite your résumé using the same words used in the job posting.
	- To increase you chance of being discovered, use the same words that they used in the first part of the job description.
- Tip 2: If you have a specific skill that is posted as required, put it in your résumé exactly the way it is written in the Internet posting.
	- Find ways to describe those skills that might come up in a keyword search based on the job description.
- Tip 3: Focus your résumé on the job as described.
	- Once you get to the interview, you have to be very careful to craft a good “fit” story.
	- Do not appear to be a generalist or a multidisciplinary person on your résumé or in the first interview.
- Tip 4: Always bring a fresh, nicely printed copy of your résumé to an interview.
	- There is a time to “stand out” later in the process, but if you do it in the beginning, you will be ejected from the candidate pool.

### The super-job description syndrome
- In our experience, if more than eight people have been through the wringer and no decisions have been made, the hiring process is probably broken. This is a sign that the company may not be a great place to work, and you might want to walk quickly to the exit.

### The phantom job list syndrome
- Many companies have a rule that before they can hire someone for a job they have to post the job description, purportedly to make sure that the best candidates are identified and hired.

### Warning: Cool companies and False Positive
- They prefer use general job description and make sure they can get as more as candidate possible, but actually these job description basically say nothing.

## 8. Designing Your Dream Job
- You design your dream job through a process of actively seeking and co-creating it. Dream job is **not** waiting out there
- He got access to the opportunities that produced those seven offers not by asking for a job but by asking for people’s life stories—fifty-six times.
- By Interviewing, they might give you the possiblity by asking the question like this: **“Kurt, you seem very interested in what we do here, and from what you’ve said so far, it sounds like you have talents we could use. Have you ever thought of working someplace like this?”**
- If they don't, you can ask them politely by this way:  **“The more I learn about XYZ Environmental and the more people I meet here, the more fascinating it becomes. I wonder, Allen, what steps would be involved in exploring how someone like me might become a part of this organization?”** Even they cannot give you a chance, they might introduce some chances for you.
- 4/5 positions only available via networking.

### People: the other world wide web
- Not **do** networking, **participate** network

### Focus on offers-not jobs
- Focus on pursuing number of offers make you being geniunely curious about the job, not convincing the company to hire you.

## 9. Choosing Happiness
- There is no right choice, only good choice

### The life design choosing process
- Step 1: Gather and Create Options
    - Having good insights about yourself, exploring options about where to engage with the world, and prototyping experiences are the ways that you can pursue.
    - Writing your Workview and Lifeview, to create mind maps, do your three Odyssey Plan alternatives, and prototype conversations and experiences.
 - Step 2: Narrow Down the List
     - Jam Study: Though more choice can attract more customer to stop and see, but reduce the sell.
     - In fact, most minds can choose effectively between only three to five options.
     - If you get frozen in front of your daunting list of possibilities, then, in fact, you have no options. Remember that options only actually create value in your life when they are chosen and realize.
     - So what exactly do you do with too many options? Simple. Get rid of some.
     - But eventually you’ll be in that overwhelmed-by-too-many-options place and have to get rid of a bunch of those jams. How? Just cross them off your list.
     - Remember, if you’ve got too many options, you really don’t have any, so you’ve got nothing to lose.
     - Only after the choice was named did you become aware of your preference.
     - If you cross out the wrong ones, you’ll know afterward.
- Step 3: Choose Discerningly
    - Choose to think for the next one to three days that you are the person who has made the decision to pick Alternative A. Choice A is your really right now.
    - You are living calmly as one who has chosen A.
    - After one to three days of this, then take at least a day or two off to be your regular self and reset. Then do the same thing with Alternative B, then another reset break, then Alternative C.
- Step 4: Let Go and Move On
    - You can’t make “the best choice,” because you can’t know what that best choice was until all the consequences have played out.
    - It turns out that reversibility is not conducive to establishing reliable happiness with a decision.
    - When we make a decision in the face of many options, or just while perceiving that there are lots of other options that we don’t even know about, we are less happy with our choice.
    - Happiness is not having it all, is letting go of what you don't need.
- Designers don’t agonize. They don’t dream about what could have been. They don’t spin their wheels. And they don’t waste their futures by hoping for a better past. Life designers see the adventure in whatever life they are currently building and living into. This is how you choose happiness.

## 10. Failure Immunity
- Life is a infinite game, not a finite game. Thus, there is no failure in life. All failure is just a process, not a outcome.
- A Better way to imagine life design process: Being(Chapter1, 2, and 3) > Doing(Chapter4, 5, and 6) > Becoming(Chapter 8) > Being...

### Failure Reframe Exercise
1. Log you failures.
2. Categorize your failures.
    - Screwups: simple mistakes about things your normally get right.
    - Weaknesses: some failures are just part of your makeup, and your best strategy is avoidance of the situations that prompt them instead of improvement.
    - Growth opportunities: failures don't have to happen, or at least don't have to happen next time.
3. Identify growth insight.

### Don't Fight Reality
- In life design, there are no wrong choices; there are no regrets. There are just prototypes, some that succeed and some that fail.
- Some of our greatest learning comes from a failed prototype, because then we know what to build differently next time.

### [Try Stuff] Reframing Failure
1. Using the worksheet below (or downloading it from www.designingyour.life), look back over the last week(or month or year), and log your failures.
2. Categorize them as Screwups, Weaknesses, Growth opportunities.
3. Identify your growth insights.
4. Build a habit of converting failures to growth by doing this once or twice a month.

## 11. Building a Team

### Identify Your Team
- Supporters: people who close enough to you that their encouragement helps keep you going and their feedback is of real use.
- Players: active participants in your life design project.
- Intimates: family or really close friends who will be affected by your decision.
- The Team: don't have to be your best friends. 3 to 6 people are better.

### Team Roles and Rules

#### Roles
- Facilitators: the person who organize the meeting and know how it works.

#### Rules
- Respectful
- Confidential
- Participative(no holding back)
- Generative(constructive, no skeptical or judging)

### Calling All Mentors

#### Advice and Counsel
- Advice: Started with "If I were you...". Good advice come from expertise.
- Counsel: Always helpful. Focus on understanding you with listening and will offer you possible reframing of your situations.

#### Discernment
- Mentors can help you make good decision by their objective observation.

#### The Long View and Local View
- You can have mentors on different subject.
- Ask someone be your mentor with "Hey, Harold. I really appreciate the way you and Louise have raise your kids, and frankly, this whole father thing scares the heck outta me. Could I buy you a cup of coffee just to hear some of your stories about that sometimes."

### Beyond Team To Community
- Kindred Purpose
- Meets Regularly
- Shared Ground: Eg: all are father.
- To Know and Be Known: knowing each other to make everyone you feel like a group.

### [Try Stuff] Building a Team
1. Make a list of three to five people who might be a part of your Life Design Team. Think of your supporters, your intimates, your mentors or possible mentors. Ideally, these will be three to five people also actively engaged in designing their lives.
2. Make sure everyone have a copy of the book (or buy books for everyone), so all the members of your team understand how life design works and have reviewed the team roles and rules.
3. Agree to meet Regularly and actively to co-create a well-designed life as a community.

## 12. Conclusion
- Life-design is a never-ending project of building your way forward.

### Disrupting Life
- We introduce the idea of life design in this book by telling you five simple things you need to do: (1) be curious, (2) try stuff (bias to action) (3) reframe problems (4) know it's a process(awareness), and (5) ask for help (radical collaboration). We've reminded you of these mind-sets throughout the book as we've walked through the various ideas and tools that constitute life design.

### Just Two More Things
- Your Compass: You Workview and Lifeview. These provide the foundation for your answer to "How's it going?" They determine if you're living a coherent life in which you've got *who you are, what you believe and what you're doing* in adequate alignment.
- Your Practice: Meditation or some good habit that make you happy and have real joy like something this book mention in chapter 9.

### So-How's It Going?
- Life design is ultimately a way of life that will transform how you look at your life and how you live your life. The end result of a well-designed life is a life well lived.
